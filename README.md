# Fake Review Detection System in Vietnamese
E-commerce platforms like Shopee, Tiki, and Lazada, along with social media sites such as Facebook and TikTok Shop, have become major influences on consumer behavior. Product reviews are a key factor in purchasing decisions, but many sellers resort to fake reviews to boost sales or improve rankings. These fake reviews, often generated by scripts or automated tools, mislead consumers and harm business reputations.

Detecting fake reviews is crucial, especially with the use of sentiment analysis and machine learning to identify deceptive content. In Vietnam, while e-commerce is growing rapidly, research and technology for detecting fake reviews in Vietnamese are limited. This study aims to develop a model to detect fake reviews in Vietnamese, helping consumers make informed decisions and improving the transparency of digital platforms.
## Research Objectives
- Analyze linguistic features: Identify language characteristics of fake reviews (vocabulary, sentence structure, tone).

- Create a labeled dataset: Collect and label reviews as "genuine" or "fake" from popular e-commerce platforms.

- Apply sentiment analysis and machine learning: Use sentiment analysis and machine learning models to detect fake reviews.

- Evaluate model performance: Assess accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.

- Propose a practical solution: Develop web
## Dataset
The generated fake reviews dataset, containing 2500 fake reviews and 2500 real product reviews. OR = Original reviews (presumably human created and authentic); CG = Computer-generated fake reviews.
## Machine Learning Algorithms Used
1. Random forest
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Logistic Regression
4. Decision Tree
5. XGBoost
6. PhoBERT + Random Forest
## Performance Overview of ML Models Leveraged
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved the highest prediction accuracy at 72.5%, closely followed by the XGBoost model with an accuracy of 72%. The PhoBERT + Random Forest model also performed well, with an accuracy of 72%. The Random Forest model had a prediction accuracy of 67.2%, while Logistic Regression reached 72.2%. The Decision Tree model performed the worst, with an accuracy of only 60.6%.

## Develop web
- Flask: A Python web framework used to develop lightweight and easily deployable web applications. Flask also supports creating and using HTML files like home.html and index.html for the user interface, making it easy to communicate with the application's backend.
- Joblib: A library used to load and use pre-trained machine learning models from stored files (svm_model.pkl).
- Gensim: A machine learning library used to train the Word2Vec model (word2vec.model), converting words in reviews into vectors.
