# Fake Review Detection System in Vietnamese
E-commerce platforms like Shopee, Tiki, and Lazada, along with social media sites such as Facebook and TikTok Shop, have become major influences on consumer behavior. Product reviews are a key factor in purchasing decisions, but many sellers resort to fake reviews to boost sales or improve rankings. These fake reviews, often generated by scripts or automated tools, mislead consumers and harm business reputations.

Detecting fake reviews is crucial, especially with the use of sentiment analysis and machine learning to identify deceptive content. In Vietnam, while e-commerce is growing rapidly, research and technology for detecting fake reviews in Vietnamese are limited. This study aims to develop a model to detect fake reviews in Vietnamese, helping consumers make informed decisions and improving the transparency of digital platforms.
